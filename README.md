Code for the calculations in the manuscript    "Information geometry for Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein quantum statistics" <br>
Preprint available at <url>https://arxiv.org/</url>

IGQC.py provides the numerical calculation for the functions <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathcal{A}">  (Equation 33 in the manuscript), <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathcal{A}_c"> (44), <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathcal{B}"> (36), and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathcal{B}_c"> (45) as python functions. These calculation rely on the mpmath lybrary and its implementation of polylogarithms.

The notebooks available explain how all the graphs and figures presented in the manuscript were generated.
