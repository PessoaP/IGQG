# IGQG (Information Geometry of Quantum Gases)

This is a library for calculations of several functions on statistical mechanics of quantum systems. Mainly, this library calculations are based on the precise calculation  of the polylogarithm family of function given by mpmath. 

Examples of usage are given as the code generating figures in some of my scientific papers.


The ipython notebooks titled: "Fraction and C_v.ipynb" and "Minimum of c_v derivative.ipynb" generate the figures presented in the article "Bose-Einstein statistics for a finite number of particles" (Accepted at Physical Review A (https://journals.aps.org/pra/accepted/a5074N05Ucf1d42bf02a0978a6e5b39c42156fcf6) preprint available at this repository).


The ipython notebooks titled: " Bosons Curvature-Fugacity plot.ipynb", "Bosons Metric determinant.ipynb", "Bosons plot curvature.ipynb", and "Fermion plots in Logarithm scale.ipynb" generate the figures presented in the article "Information geometry for Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein quantum statistics" [Physica A 576, 126061 (2021)] (published: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2021.126061, preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00935).
